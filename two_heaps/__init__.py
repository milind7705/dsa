# Static or streaming data: The input could either be:
# Linear data: The input data is linear but not sorted. If the input data is sorted, this pattern wonâ€™t apply.
# Stream of data: The input data is a continuous stream of data.
# Maxima and minima calculation: The input data can be categorized in two parts,
# and we need to repeatedly calculate two maxima,
# two minima, or one maximum and one minimum from the two sets, respectively.
